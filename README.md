Challenge Four

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

In this assignment I attempted to create a coding quiz using the concepts that we have learned so far in our coding bootcamp.

This quiz consists of a series of questions; each question answered correctly will add a point to the final score. An incorrect answer will remove 10 seconds from the quiz time, which starts at 60 seconds. 

At the end of the quiz you will enter your initials which will be added to the high score list.
